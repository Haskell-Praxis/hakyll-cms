# Hakyll CMS

## Notice

This project is under heavy development, not functional and should not be used in production under any circumstances!

---

This is a CMS frontend for the Haskell based static site generator [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). Its aim is to make writing sites easier by providing a web interface that manages the content of your Hakyll installation.
